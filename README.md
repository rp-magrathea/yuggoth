# Yuggoth
A collection of blank maps, sorted by genre then type.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to provide maps for roleplay settings.

## Commission Agreement
For all commissioned maps, two copies will be made: the requester's version, including names, and our version, without names. Like our other resources, at the time that a site comes to a close, any maps that were made will be added to our collection and made available under a Creative Commons Zero license.

## Disclaimers
While all maps found within this repo are under the CC0 license, please keep in mind the following:

A Creative Commons Zero license does not waive liability for use of copyrighted material. While these maps are open and available for use, modification, and distribution, both Inkarnate and Campaign Cartographer 3 retain copyrights to their artwork, icons, etc.  These individual images may not be distributed unless part of a larger work, i.e. a map.
